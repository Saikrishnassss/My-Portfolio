            <p id="about-me-short">
                Hello! I’m Sai Krishna, a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at Sathyabama University, Chennai. Currently, I maintain a CGPA of 7.2, and I am constantly striving to improve both my academic and technical skills.
            </p>
            
            <p id="about-me-long" style="display: none;">
                As an aspiring Software Development Engineer, I have a strong passion for creating innovative software solutions that solve real-world problems. My interest in software development is driven by my love for coding, problem-solving, and building efficient systems. I’m particularly drawn to the challenge of optimizing code, working with cutting-edge technologies, and delivering products that add value to users.
                Alongside my enthusiasm for software development, I am also deeply interested in Cybersecurity. With the ever-growing number of online threats, I believe it is essential to build secure and robust systems. I am constantly exploring various aspects of cybersecurity, from ethical hacking to cryptography, and I aim to contribute to making the digital world a safer place.
                Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that helped me apply my knowledge in practical scenarios. Whether it's coding in languages like Python, Java, or C++, or exploring web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I enjoy collaborating with others on projects and believe in the power of teamwork and knowledge sharing.
                I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities that technology holds. My goal is to continue learning, improving my skills, and working on impactful projects that have a meaningful impact on society. I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry!
